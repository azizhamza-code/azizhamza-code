- 👋 Hi, I’m @azizhamza-code
- I'm passionate about a wide range of topics, from writing clean Python code, LLM, LLMOps, LLMOS, RAG, MLOps to the low-level aspects of computer science, operating systems, and software engineering principles. AWS also holds a significant place in my interests.

- By day, I work as a consultant, delving into abstract concepts like AWS, RAG, LLM, LLMOps, and Python. By night, I transform into a hacker, exploring low-level concepts such as operating systems, programming language concepts, and data structures, striving to become a better engineer
